# XML Extended Markup Language
XML syntacticly similar to HTML, but does not describe presentation like HTML does

<person>
  <age>21</age>
  <name>Travis</name>
  <city>Los Angeles</name>
</person>

# JSON JavaScript Object Notation
JSON looks exactly like  JS objects, but everything is a string.

{
  "person": {
    "age": "21",
    "name": "Travis",
    "city", "Los Angeles"
  }
}
