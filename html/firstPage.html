  <p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and
    typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard
    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
    centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
