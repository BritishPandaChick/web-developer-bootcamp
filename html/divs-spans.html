      <p>Lorem Ipsum <span>is simply dummy text</span> of the printing and
        typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
